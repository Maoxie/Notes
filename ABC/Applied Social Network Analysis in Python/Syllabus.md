# Course Syllabus

## Module One

- introduce different types of networks and why we study them

- basic elements of networks: nodes, edges, and attributes
- types of networks: directed, undirected, weighted, signed, and bipartite
- Using NetworkX libarary

## Module Two

- analyze the connectivity of a network
  - distance
  - reachability
  - redundancy of paths between nodes
- the robustness of a network

## Module Three

- importance or centrality of a node in a network
- centrality measures (assumptions and algorithms):
  - Degree, Closeness, and Betweenness centrality
  - Page Rank
  - Hubs and Authorities

- compare the ranking of nodes by centrality produced by the different measures

## Module Four

- the evolution of networks over time
- different models that generate networks
  - Preferential Attachment Model
  - Small World Networks
- link prediction
  - predict whether a pair of disconnected nodes will be connected in the future
